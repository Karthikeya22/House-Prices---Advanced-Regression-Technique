# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Technique

Real Estate is not only a general citizen’s major concern, but also a vital part in a country’s economy. As the price of Housing continue to increase, it is important to predict those prices accurately. In this project, we try to predict housing prices by using various ML algorithms (We use data from Kaggle Website) and by considering various housing factors like Square feet, Location, Transportation, Amenities etc. ​

Features and Algorithms like Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Lasso, XG Boost and LG Boost are used here to build the prediction model to predict the prices of the houses.
